- You should only include payments made by cash, check, ACH transfer or other direct means on Form 1099-MISC [^2]
- Payments by credit card or through third-party transaction networks that are reportable on Form 1099-K (see below) are specifically excluded from Form 1099-MISC reporting.
- You do not need to file a Form 1099-MISC if your payments are below the minimum reporting threshold. For most transaction types, the threshold is $600.
    - You are not prohibited from filing if the minimum threshold wasn't met, and the recipient is not excused from reporting the income regardless of whether you file or the threshold was met.
