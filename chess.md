# Other
 - Basically, if either side possesses more than a full piece (minor) advantage (and in some cases, a clear two pawn advantage is good enough) they should be looking for every opportunity to trade piece. 


# End Game

### King and King and Bishop vs King

And only once you've reached a higher level (I would say 1800 Rated) -> King and Knight & Bishop vs King... -- When you're ready!

### 4. Avoid creating weak squares in your position

### 5. Always blockade your opponentâ€™s isolated pawn with a knight

### 6. Occupy open files with your rooks

### 7. Keep the bishop pair
