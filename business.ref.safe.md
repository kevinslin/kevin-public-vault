## Summary

- Simple Agreement for Future Equity
- it's an instrument where the investor will give you money now in exchange for a promise from the company to give shares to the investor at a future date when you raise money on a priced round.
- negotiation points:
    - how much money the investor will put into the company 
    - valuation cap
- SAFE is not debt

- safe holder ownership is measured after (post) all the safe money is accounted for - which is its own round now - but still before (pre) the new money in the priced round that converts and dilutes the safes (usually the Series A, but sometimes Series Seed).
- post-money safe has what we think is a huge advantage for both founders and investors - the ability to calculate immediately and precisely how much ownership of the company has been sold. 
    -  It’s critically important for founders to understand how much dilution is caused by each safe they sell, just as it is fair for investors to know how much ownership of the company they have purchased.
- “pro rata” right
    -  new (optional) template side letter that provides the investor with a pro rata right in the Series A Preferred Stock financing, based on the investor’s as-converted safe ownership
    -  Whether or not a startup and an investor enter into the side letter with a safe will now be a choice that the parties make, and it may depend on a variety of factors.
    - factors to consider may include (among others) the purchase amount of the safe, and amount of future dilution the pro rata right will cause for the founders - an amount that can be now forecast with much greater accuracy when post-money safes are used.
- advantage
    - Startups can close with an investor as soon as both parties are ready to sign and the investor is ready to wire money, instead of trying to coordinate a single close with all investors simultaneously
    - As a flexible, one-document security without numerous terms to negotiate, safes save startups and investors money in legal fees and reduce the time spent negotiating the terms of the investment. Startups and investors will usually only have to negotiate one item: the valuation cap

- history
    - Y Combinator introduced the safe (simple agreement for future equity) in late 2013, and since then, it has been used by almost all YC startups
    - Our first safe was a “pre-money” safe, because at the time of its introduction, startups were raising smaller amounts of money in advance of raising a priced round of financing
    - The safe was a simple and fast way to get that first money into the company, and the concept was that holders of safes were merely early investors in that future priced round
    - things have changed now
    - While safes are being used for these seed rounds, these rounds are really better considered as wholly separate financings, rather than “bridges” into later priced rounds.

## Layout
- source: [^yc-safe]
- Section one talks about what happens in various different sets of events. 
    - most of the time, what's going to happen is there will be an equity financing at some point in the future
    - other cases
        -  there might be a liquidity event, i.e., the company might get sold before the SAFE converts
        -  company might decide to close down whilst the SAFE is still outstanding
-  section two is just the definition section
-  Section three are the representations that the company makes to the investor.
    - company is duly formed, it's correctly formed in Delaware
- Section four is the representations that the investors make to the company
    - so it's things like the investor saying, "Yes, I agree, I'm an accredited investor.
-  section five is kind of legal boilerplate language that needs to be in there

## Terms

### post money valuation
- source: [^yc-safe]
- the pre-money valuation plus the amount of money raised equals the post-money valuation of the company
- eg. if you have a $5 million pre-money valuation and you raise $1 million, then the post-money valuation of the company is $6 million. 

### valuation cap
- source: [^vc]
<!-- -->
-  It entitles investors to equity priced at the lower of the valuation cap or the pre-money valuation in the subsequent financing

- A SAFE grants the right to receive a certain number of shares in a Series A financing.
- Discount Rate
    - eg. 20%
        - If Series A investors pay $1.00 per share, then the SAFE investors buy their shares at $0.80.
    - Note that the SAFE defines a “Discount Rate”, not a discount. This just means 100 minus the discount. A 20% discount is the same as an 80% Discount Rate. 
- Valuation Cap
    -  upper limit on the price per share a SAFE investor will pay for Series A stock
    - defined in terms of the company’s market cap rather than share price
    - The valuation cap is usually between $2,000,000 - $10,000,000

## Events
- After the SAFE investor signs the SAFE and wires her funds, the SAFE sits quietly on your cap table until one of three major events trigger it into action: (a) a Series A financing, (b) an acquisition, and (c) a bankruptcy.

### equity financing
- The SAFE will convert into equity upon an an “Equity Financing”. This will usually be the startup’s Series A financing.


- “Conversion Price” means the either: (1) the Safe Price or (2) the Discount Price, whichever calculation results in a greater number of shares of Safe Preferred Stock.
- e “Safe Price” or the “Discount Price”, and the SAFE Investors get to use whichever price is lower.

- SAFE Price
    - price per share equal to the Valuation Cap divided by the Company Capitalization.
    - Valuation Cap is set out at the top of the SAFE. It’s usually something like $5,000,000.
    -  Company Capitalization refers to the number of (1) outstanding shares (assuming all options are exercised) plus (2) all of the shares in the employee stock plan. 

- Discount Price
    - price per share of the Standard Preferred Stock sold in the Equity Financing multiplied by the Discount Rate.

- Standard Preferred Stock is just the stock the normal Series A investors are buying
- Equity Financing” is usually the Series A
- Discount Rate is defined at the top of the SAFE, and usually something like 80%.

- If the startup’s valuation at the Series A is lower than the Valuation Cap, the Safe Investors will be paying for their Series A shares at the Discount Price (the Series A price multiples by Discount Rate).
- This section says that the SAFE investor will sign the same Series A docs as the Series A investors. 
- After a Series A, the former SAFE holders (now series A stockholders) will have the right to buy stock in the Series B financing. These Pro rata rights are like an option to allow the former SAFE holders to maintain their pro rata ownership share of the company. The exact type of pro rata rights is set out under the definition of “Pro Rata Rights
