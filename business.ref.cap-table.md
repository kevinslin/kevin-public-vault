## Summary
- source: [^1]
<!-- -->
- A key benefit of being a co-founder or early employee is the possibility of filing an 83b election with the IRS. Filing can dramatically reduce the taxes you pay as the company value grows and can make buying your stock affordable if you choose to leave before a liquidity event.

### Step 3: First employees
- define an offer in absolute numbers of shares instead of as a percentage of the company. Percentages are ambiguous and quickly become inaccurate as the company grows.
