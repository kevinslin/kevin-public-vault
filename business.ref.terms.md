- details
    - Fully diluted shares affect the EPS of a company, which is a common metric for assessing relative value and profitability
    - If a company can increase earnings per common share, it is considered to be more valuable and the publicly traded share price may increase
- While full dilution may not occur all at once, it indicates how many shares might be outstanding in the future, based on current company policy regarding conversions.
