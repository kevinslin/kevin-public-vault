### do i need to pay myself a salary as a founder?
- no but if you have multiple founders and one leaves, they could sue for not being paid

- example [^1]
    - A founder employed in California is entitled to compensation at minimum wage (currently $10 an hour, but higher in some cities and localities) or above; and:

    Overtime for any time worked beyond 8 hours in a day and 40 hours in a week, unless covered by a statutory exemption. The California professional exemptions require that the employee be paid at least US$41,600 annually and satisfy other requirements, such as supervising two or more employees and carrying out executive functions for the executive exemption. If the founder doesnâ€™t fit into the federal bona fide executive exemption described above, note that the minimum amount of pay to be exempt from federal overtime rose to US$47,476 on December 1, 2016.
    Regular payment (at least twice per month, though once per month is permitted under certain circumstances), which must be made in the form of a negotiable instrument (i.e., cash or cash equivalent). Equity doesn't count for this purpose
